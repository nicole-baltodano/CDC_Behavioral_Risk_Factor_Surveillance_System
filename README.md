üìù Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing datasets from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The primary goal is to investigate health conditions, such as diabetes, and create meaningful insights through:

Feature engineering
Data restructuring
Aggregation analysis

üìä Data Sources
1Ô∏è‚É£ General BRFSS Data
Source: [CDC Open Data Portal](https://data.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Surveillance-System-BRFSS-P/dttw-5yxu/about_data )
Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pu6W1LGDceD1-iUHXx8daOcYEdvEsA4V/view?usp=sharing
Description:
This dataset includes data on multiple health conditions and demographic factors.
The analysis focuses on filtering the Topic column for diabetes or other relevant health topics.
Challenges:
Restructuring the Break_Out and Break_Out_Category columns to create new features.
Aggregating Sample_Size for meaningful insights is still a work in progress.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Diabetes-Specific BRFSS Data (2023)
Source: [CDC Annual Data](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2023.html )
Dataset: [Drive Link to Diabetes-Specific BRFSS Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X36RNwM8axpjgiRieOxz5Z0jNWfTYIMK/view?usp=sharing)
Description:
This dataset is focused solely on diabetes.
Each column corresponds to distinct features, making it ready for direct analysis.
