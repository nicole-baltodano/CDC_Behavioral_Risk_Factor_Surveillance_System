Summer Project: Analysis of BRFSS Data
Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing datasets from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The primary goal is to investigate health conditions such as diabetes and create meaningful insights through feature engineering and data restructuring.

Data Sources
General BRFSS Data:

Source: [CDC Open Data Portal](https://data.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Surveillance-System-BRFSS-P/dttw-5yxu/about_data )
Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pu6W1LGDceD1-iUHXx8daOcYEdvEsA4V/view?usp=sharing

Description:
This dataset includes data on multiple health conditions and demographic factors.
The focus of the analysis is on filtering the Topic column for diabetes or other relevant topics.

Challenges:

The dataset requires restructuring to regroup Break_Out and Break_Out_Category columns into new features.
Summing the Sample_Size for aggregated insights is still a work in progress.

Diabetes-Specific BRFSS Data (2023):

Dataset: [Drive Link to Diabetes-Specific BRFSS Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X36RNwM8axpjgiRieOxz5Z0jNWfTYIMK/view?usp=sharing)
Description:
This dataset is focused solely on diabetes.
Each column corresponds to distinct features, making it easier to analyze directly.
